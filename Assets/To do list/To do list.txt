To do list:

1) Try to finish Lost Wallet Quest

Bonus: Adjust Raycast so that it can detect Interactable objects if it's within it's vicinity (only from the front of the player).



Core Systems:

0) Implement a Quest Manager.
	- Stores, tracks, and updates active quests

1) Implement a State Machine for NPC:
	- Idle
	- Waiting
	- Helped
	- Transformed
	Bonus: Implement optional animation states (sad --> hopeful, etc.)

2) Implement Ripple Effect Manager (Cause and Effect System):
	- Tracks completed acts of kindess and triggers world/NPC changes (trigger Event)
	- Could be event-driven (C# Action/Event) or state-based(ScriptableObject flags)

3) Area Unlocking System
	- Certain areas are blocked until certain NPCs are helped (gates, fog, overgrowth)
	- Could use a basic UnlockManager that listens to kindness progress

4) Environmental Detail Triggers
	- After helping someone, small changes happen in the village
		- flower bloom
		- birds return
		- children play
		- candels light themselves
	- Use simple Unity triggers + particle systems or light activation

5) World Feedback System (Visual/Auditory)
	- Color grading changes, ambient audio layering, particles, or lighting changes as acts of kindness accumulate
	- Optional: a visual aura around player subtly intensifies (like kindness “energy”)

6) Journal or Memory System (Optional but Powerful)
	- A log or floating UI that reflects your kindness ripple (what you've done and who it affected)
	- helps the player see the emotional arc of the world

7) Companion System (Optional)
	- A small nonverbal creature or spirit that reacts to your actions
	- Not required, but can symbolize the emotional state of the world

Which of the above systems SHOULD be implemented (from most important to least):
1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7


Try to do:
State machine for when player is in a dialogue	---> Helps keep the code base modular and loosely coupled


Completed:

1) UI for when interacting with Interactables (NPC Dialogue, environmental objects, etc.)
	- possibly helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Gc_JHiKWA

2) Work on 3rd person camera

To do list June 7th:

1) UI for when interacting with Interactables (NPC Dialogue, environmental objects, etc.)
	- possibly helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Gc_JHiKWA

2) Work on 3rd person camera

3) Bonus: Adjust Raycast so that it can detect Interactable objects if it's within it's vicinity (only from the front of the player).


Try to do:
State machine for when player is in a dialogue	---> Helps keep the code base modular and loosely coupled
